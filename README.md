# Time Machine Portfolio

## Project Objective
This project is my personal homepage 
The main objective was to design and implement a multi-page portfolio using **vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript**.  
The site acts as a “Time Machine,” where turning a dial lets the user navigate through different eras of my career:  
- **Ancient Past** → Education and early experiences, shown in a stone-age themed style  
- **Age of Discovery** → My skills, displayed in a retro 2000’s neon style  
- **Current** → My present work, designed like a chat page  
- **Future** → My future goals, displayed in a futuristic, animated theme  

The creative addition is the **interactive Time Machine dial** that rotates and highlights different eras. Users can “enter” to explore each page, with animations and custom JavaScript functionality built from scratch.

## Creative Addition

- Rotating Dial Navigation: A custom JavaScript feature that highlights and changes pages when turned.

- Spider Animation: Black spiders crawl randomly across the page with animated legs.

- Typewriter Matrix Intro: Animated green terminal-style intro.

- Era Themes: Each page has a unique creative design (Stone Age, Retro 2000’s, Futuristic).

## Use of GenAI Tools

I used ChatGPT (GPT-5, September 2025) to assist with:

- Brainstorming layout and creative theme ideas

- Generating starter code for  spider crawl, typewriter (vanilla JavaScript animations ).

- Improving CSS styling (Matrix neon effect, retro/futuristic looks).

All AI outputs were reviewed, modified, and integrated manually into the project. No AI-generated code was copied directly without understanding, testing, and adjusting.

Prompts used included: “ How to make a spider crawl across the screen,” “how to add a typewriter effect,”. 

## Pages

- index.html → Homepage with dial + intro + About Me + Contact

- ancient.html → Ancient Past (Stone Age education & experience)

- discovery.html → Age of Discovery (skills in retro 2000’s style)

- current.html → Current (chat-style page)

- future.html → Future (animated constellation goals page)

## At least 2 pages without AI, plus 1 page with AI-assisted creative addition:

- Without AI: ancient.html, current.html, Index.html, Age of Discovery 

- With AI creativity: future.html (futuristic background + goals), spider crawl , type writier , Font glitch 

## Vanilla JS Feature

The rotating dial navigation is my custom vanilla JavaScript feature. It controls which “era” is selected, highlights it, and links to the correct page. It was fully written and customized for this project.
