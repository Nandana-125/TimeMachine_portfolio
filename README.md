# Time Machine Portfolio

## Project Objective
This project is my personal homepage 
The main objective was to design and implement a multi-page portfolio using **vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ JavaScript**.  
The site acts as a “Time Machine,” where turning a dial lets the user navigate through different eras of my career:  
- **Ancient Past** → Education and early experiences, shown in a stone-age themed style  
- **Age of Discovery** → My skills, displayed in a retro 2000’s neon style  
- **Current** → My present work, designed like a chat page  
- **Future** → My future goals, displayed in a futuristic, animated theme  

The creative addition is the **interactive Time Machine dial** that rotates and highlights different eras. Users can “enter” to explore each page, with animations and custom JavaScript functionality built from scratch.
